# Welcome to My Pokemon App
***

## Task
The My Pokemon App addresses the need for a user-friendly platform to explore Pokémon data. The challenge lies in efficiently fetching and displaying large volumes of data from external APIs while maintaining high performance and a responsive design. Additionally, ensuring seamless navigation, search functionality, and an engaging user experience were key aspects of the development process.


## Description
The My Pokemon App is a web application built using modern web technologies, including Vite, React, and Axios, with CSS for styling. The app leverages Axios to fetch data from an external Pokémon API (PokéAPI) and React to manage the user interface and interactivity. It provides an intuitive and responsive design for users to browse, search, and view detailed information about Pokémon.

Key features of the app include:
A dynamic search bar to quickly locate Pokémon by name or type.
A detailed Pokémon profile page that displays stats, abilities, and evolutions.
A responsive design that ensures compatibility across desktop and mobile devices.
Fast build times and optimized performance thanks to Vite.
